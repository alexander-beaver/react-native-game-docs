For this project, we will use React Navigation as a way to handle pages.

React Navigation is a very popular library to handle views in React Native, which normally does not support React Navigation.

To add it to your project, navigate to the directory in the command line and enter:

```bash
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view react-navigation react-navigation-drawer react-navigation-stack react-navigation-animated-switch
```

You may need `sudo` on Linux.
